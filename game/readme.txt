I have created a Multi-Mod with walkthrough for Academy Live! by passhonQ

Mod Features:

Custom Cheat menu to Edit a few items
Walkthough with Suggestions.
Customizable Quick Menu Position
Custom Music Player with In-Game Overlay using In-Game Music
In-Game Mod shortcuts button "?" Just above Music Player Overlay
Toggle between standard Notifications of Stack Notifications
Fadeable text with options to change to suit you preference
Custom Savenames
Hotkeys for choice menus
Every option can be toggled in preferences

Have tested that if you remove mod saves still work even if a save was made while the mod was installed.

The mod works without modifying any of the original files so theoretically it should not affect saves.

The way passhonQ develops the walkthrough would need to be updated on every release.

The other options should work without a hitch but will be tested on every release.

Drop the contents into game folder

If the mod is installed correctly it will show on the main menu mod installed

The Current Mod Version is 0.06.2.1_alpha
