I have created a Multi-Mod with walkthrough for Academy Live! by passhonQ

The mod works without modifying any of the original files so theoretically it should not affect saves.

The way passhonQ develops the walkthrough would need to be updated on every release.

The other options should work without a hitch but will be tested on every release.

Drop the contents into game folder

If the mod is installed correctly it will show on the main menu mod installed

The Current Mod Version is **0.06.2.1_alpha**
